1) There are duplicate files in the Executive packages. According to the below post I choose the latter method as suggested by Prof.

2)There are multiple files in my project which will exceed the Metric limits in the VisualCodeAnalyzerExes application.
  All those are Prof's codes and I have not changed the functions datatype or the arguments.

3)The VisualCodeAnalyzerExes application will show that the Converter.h is having the public data for the function below.
"std::vector<std::string> convert(const std::vector<std::string>& files);" 

But the same function was provided in AmmarDemo_CodePublisher_Pr1 solution converter.h
The project requirement made me change the Converter.h file but I have not altered the code which was given to us.
